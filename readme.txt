The issue with your existing YAML configuration might be related to running Chrome in a headless environment without proper configuration. The error message indicates that Chrome failed to start due to the DevToolsActivePort file not existing. This is often caused by Chrome failing to start properly in a headless environment.

Here are a few adjustments to your YAML file to ensure that Chrome is properly configured to run headlessly:

Install Xvfb to create a virtual display.
Run Xvfb to set up the virtual display before starting Chrome.
Add the necessary Chrome options for headless mode.
Here is the updated YAML file with these adjustments:

yaml
Copy code
name: Run sporttechXfull_scrape

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 16 * * *" # Runs daily at 4:10 PM UTC
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12' # Specify the Python version you need

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Install Chrome
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y wget unzip xvfb
          wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
          sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
          sudo apt-get install -f

      - name: Verify Chrome Installation
        run: google-chrome --version

      - name: Run Python script
        env:
          DISPLAY: ":99.0"
        run: |
          Xvfb :99 -ac &
          sleep 3 # Give Xvfb some time to start
          python sporttechXfull_scrape.py

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions@github.com'
          git add sportstech.csv
          git commit -m "Update sportstech.csv via GitHub Actions"
          git push
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Additionally, make sure your Python script is configured to run Chrome in headless mode. Modify the options in your Python script as follows:

python
Copy code
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--incognito")
options.add_argument("--headless")  # Add headless option
options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
options.add_argument("user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36")
These changes should help ensure that Chrome starts properly in the headless environment of GitHub Actions.






Fantastic answer thank you it works. Canyou explain why this worked and my version didnt

Sure, I'm glad it worked! Here's an explanation of why the updated configuration works while your original version did not:

Original YAML Configuration Issues:
Headless Mode:

Your Python script didn't include the --headless argument in the Chrome options, which is necessary when running Chrome in a headless environment like a CI/CD pipeline. Without this, Chrome tries to start with a GUI, which isn't available in the GitHub Actions environment, leading to failures.
Virtual Display:

Chrome requires a display to run, even in headless mode, and GitHub Actions runners do not provide a display by default. Your original configuration didn't set up a virtual display using Xvfb, which simulates a display for applications that require one.
Updated YAML Configuration Fixes:
Installing Xvfb:

Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) is a display server that performs graphical operations in memory without showing any screen output. By installing Xvfb and running it in the background, we provide a virtual display that Chrome can use to operate.
Setting the DISPLAY Environment Variable:

The DISPLAY environment variable tells applications which display server to use. By setting DISPLAY: ":99.0", we direct Chrome to use the virtual display created by Xvfb.
Adding the --headless Option:

Adding --headless to the Chrome options in your Python script ensures that Chrome operates without a GUI, making it suitable for running in a server environment like GitHub Actions.
Additional Chrome Options:

--no-sandbox: This option disables the sandboxing security feature in Chrome, which can cause issues in some CI environments.
--disable-dev-shm-usage: This option addresses shared memory usage issues, which can cause Chrome to crash in some CI environments due to limited /dev/shm space.
Summary
The combination of running Xvfb to provide a virtual display and configuring Chrome to run in headless mode ensures that Chrome can start and run properly in the GitHub Actions environment. These steps are necessary because GitHub Actions runners do not have a GUI, and many CI/CD environments require applications to run headlessly.

By addressing these specific requirements, the updated configuration allows your web scraping script to execute successfully in the CI environment.
